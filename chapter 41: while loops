Question 1: The first line of a while operation sets the counter. Type the keyword that begins the second line, plus the 2 characters that follow the keyword.
Answer: while (

Question 2: What is the last character of the first line of a while statement?
Answer: {.

Question 3: Instead of a while loop, you can always use a ______ loop.
Answer: for

Question 4: Type the last line of a while statement.
Answer: }

Question 5: Drag and drop to assemble a while statement that shows the value of i in an alert.
Answer: var i = 0;
while (i <= 5) {
  alert(i);
  i++;
}

Question 6: Code the first line of a while loop. The loop runs as long as i is less than 6.
Answer: while ( < 6) {

Question 7: Code the rest of the while loop. With each loop, add the value of i to total, which has been declared beforehand. The loop runs 100 times.
while (i <= 99) {
Answer:  total = total + i;
  i++;
}

Question 8: Code the statement that needs to run above this line of code.
while (i <= 144) {
Answer: var i = 0; 

Question 9: Code a while loop that runs twice and does nothing. The counter i has already been declared and assigned 0.
Answer: while (i <= 1) {
  i++;
}
or
while (i < 2) {
  i++;
}

Question 10: I've declared two variables and assigned values to them. Code a while loop that adds i to tot with each iteration. Use i > 0 as the loop limiter.
var tot = 0;
var i = 10
Answer: while (i > 0) {
  tot = tot + i;
  i--;
}

Question 11: Code the line of a while loop that begins with while. The loop runs as long as i is greater than 10.
Answer: while (i > 10) {

Question 12: I've coded an array, shown below. Code a while loop that looks for "pig" in the array. When it finds it, an alert displays saying, "Found it!" Use the length of the array as the loop limiter. Break out of the loop when it's found.
var animals=["horse", "ox", "cow", "pig", "duck"];
Answer: var i = 0;
while (i < animals.length) {
  if (animals[i] === "pig") {
    alert("Found it!");
    break;
  }
  i++;
}​

Question 19: Code an alert that loops 3 times, alerting the value of the counter each time.
Answer: var i = 0;
while (i <= 2) {
  alert(i);
  i++;
}
The loop limiter can also be coded as i < 3.

Question 20: I've coded an array. Code a while loop that looks for "Tigers" in the array. When "Tigers" is found, an alert displays saying, "Tigers is at index [whatever its array index is] in the array." Use the length of the array as the loop limiter. Break out of the loop when "Tigers" is found. Don't change my code. Add your code below it.
var teams = ["Chiefs", "Bees", "Tigers", "Bears"];
Answer: var teams = ["Chiefs", "Bees", "Tigers", "Bears"];
var i = 0;
while (i < teams.length) {
  if (teams[i] === "Tigers") {
    alert("Tigers is at index " + i + " in the array.");
    break;
  }
  i++;
}​
