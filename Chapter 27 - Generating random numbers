Question 3: The largest number generated by the JavaScript random function is just short of ____.
Answer: 1

Question 4: If you want to convert a random number generated by JavaScript to a number in the range 1 to 50, you begin by multiplying the number by ___.
Answer: 50

Question 6: JavaScript has generated the largest possible pseudo-random number, 0.9999999999999999, which has been assigned to num. You want a number ranging from 1 to 6. 
Code the statement that converts the number to 6.9999999999999999 and assigns the result to betterNum, which hasn't been declared beforehand.
Answer: var betterNum = (num * 6) + 1;

Question 7: You want a pseudo-random number that ranges from 1 to 100. You've multiplied by 100 and added 1. The number has been assigned to y. 
Code the last step, assigning the result to x, which hasn't been declared beforehand.
Answer: var x = Math.floor(y);

Question 8: Generate a pseudo-random number and assign it to a variable that hasn't been declared beforehand.
Answer: var randomNum = Math.random();

Question 9:Code the first line of an if statement that tests whether a pseudo-random number generated within the statement is greater than .5.
Answer: if (Math.random() > .5) {

Question 10: You want a number that ranges from 1 to 10. Code the first step in converting a big decimal that has been assigned to a variable of your choosing. Assign the result to a second variable that hasn't been declared beforehand.
Answer: var convertedNum = (num * 10) + 1;

Questions 11: Code the last step in converting a pseudo-random number to a useful number. Assign the result to the same variable that represents the number you're converting.
Answer: num = Math.floor(num);

Questions 12: Code all three statements that generate a pseudo-random integer ranging from 1 to 6. Use 3 different variables, none of which have been declared beforehand.
Answer: var num1 = Math.random();
var num2 = (num1 * 6) + 1;
var num3 = Math.floor(num2);

Question 18: Generate a pseudo-random number and convert it to an integer ranging from 0 to 9999999999999999. Use the same variable, which hasn't been declared beforehand, for both numbers.
Answer: var num = Math.random();
num = num * 10000000000000000;
